# JavaScript30

Fork from javascript30 made by Wes Bos, proposed at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

In this repo you will find 30 projects, one for each day, made with plain JavaScript. The goal for this is to get more confidence working with JS, and get to know more in depth the JS functionality.
